=head1 NAME

livecd-iso-to-disk - installs bootable CD images on a USB storage devices.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<livecd-iso-to-disk> [--format] [--reset-mbr] [--noverify] [--efi] [--overlay-size-mb <size>] [\-\-home\-size\-mb <size>] [\-\-unencrypted\-home] [\-\-skipcopy]  <path-to-iso> <usb storage device>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<livecd-iso-to-disk> installs a live CD or DVD image(ISO image) onto a USB storage device. The USB storage device can then boot the installed operating system on systems which support booting via USB. B<livecd-iso-to-disk> requires an ISO image and a USB storage device. ISO images can be created with B<livecd-creator>.

B<livecd-iso-to-disk> is not a destructive process; any data you currently have on your USB stick is preserved.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item --format

Formats the USB stick and creates an MS-DOS partition table (or GPT partition table if --efi is passed).

=item --reset-mbr

Sets the Master Boot Record(MBR) of the USB storage device to the mbr.bin file from the image's syslinux directory.

=item --noverify

Disables the image validation process which occurs before the image is installed. When this option is enabled the image is not verified before installation on the USB storage device.

=item --overlay-size-mb

This option sets the overlay size in mebibytes (integer values only).  The overlay makes persistent storage available to the live operating system, if the operating system supports it.  The persistent LiveOS overlay holds image-change snapshots (using write-once, difference-tracking  storage) in the /LiveOS/overlay-<device_id> file, which, *one should note*, always grows in size due to the storage mechanism.  (The fraction of allocated space that has been consumed may be displayed by issuing the 'dmsetup status' command in a terminal session of a running LiveOS installation.)  One way to conserve the unrecoverable, overlay file space, is to specify a persistent home folder for user files, see --home-size-mb below.  The target storage device must have enough free space for the image and the overlay.  A maximum <size> of 4095 MiB is permitted for vfat-formatted devices.  If there is insufficient room on your device, you will be given information to help in adjusting your settings.

=item --home-size-mb

Sets the home directory size in mebibytes (integer values only).  A persistent home directory will be made in the /LiveOS/home.img filesystem image file.  This file space is encrypted by default, but not compressed (one may bypass encryption with the --unencrypted-home installation option).  Files in this home folder may be erased to recover and reuse their storage space.  The target storage device must have enough free space for the image, any overlay, and the home directory.  Note that the --delete-home option must also be selected to replace an existing persistent home with a new, empty one.  A maximum <size> of 4095 MiB is permitted for vfat-formatted devices.  If there is insufficient room on your device, you will be given information to help in adjusting your settings.

=item --unencrypted-home

Disables the encryption of the home directory.

=item --skipcopy

Skips the copy of the live image to the USB stick and disables the --forma, --home-size-mb, and --swap-size-mb options. The --overlay-size-mb option is changed to only reinitialize the existing overlay area, to recreate it from scratch.

The intended use of this option is to speed up testing of the boot configuration of live images.

=item --efi

Create a GPT partition table when --format is passed, and install an hybrid EFI/MBR bootloader on the disk. This is necessary for most Intel Macs.

=item --timeout

Modify the bootloader's timeout value. This overrides the value set during iso creation. Units are 1/10s

=item --totaltimeout

Add a totaltimeout to the bootloader config. This is used to force and automatic boot. This cannot be canceled by the user. Units are 1/10s
