This is a rough TODO list for developers of livecd-tools
--------------------------------------------------------

 - Overall

 - Creator

 - Installer
   - SELinux is denying the installer certain things. Need to file bug
     to fix the policy
   - Make sure all appropriate file systems are unmounted before writing
     to them in Install()
   - Lock out HAL / gnome-volume-manager / KDE equiv so file systems are
     not auto-mounted when using InstallToHarddisk()
   - Configure keyboard
     - Tricky; needs writing out to /etc/X11/xorg.conf but, uh, then
       autoconfiguration don't work at all. The right thing here, probably,
       is to insert a X11PreSessionHook that reads /etc/sysconfig/keyboard
       and chooses the appropriate xkb configuration. After talking to
       ajax on IRC he concurs. Needs to file bug for this to happen.
   - Configure locale
   - GTK+ installer!
